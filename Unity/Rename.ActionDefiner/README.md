# Rename.ActionDefiner

## Important!

After downloading and opening this part of the project for the first time, Unity will generate files for `Library` directory.
Then you will be welcomed by an Untitled scene. Because of `TextMesh Pro` not being included due to its effect on Languages meter I recommend the following actions:
1. Open `SampleScene.unity`
2. Dialog with option to import __Text Mesh Pro Essentials__ will appear.
3. __Import TMP Essentials__ using the dialog.
4. After operation is finished, TextMeshPro Text won't have correct settings. Simply restart Unity to fix that issue.

Another excluded from repo free package is yasirkula's Runtime File Browser.
